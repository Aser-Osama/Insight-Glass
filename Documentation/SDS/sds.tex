\section{Project Overview}
\subsection{Project idea}
Our project's main goal is to help professionals from different disciplines start their careers at companies where 
they can thrive. This will be achieved through radical transparency of the companies, breaking down all barriers 
and problems in the Egyptian job markets that lead to discrimination, pay gaps, and toxic work environments.

\subsection{Vision}
The vision is to transform the Egyptian job market by empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their 
career path. The project aims to address common issues of job seekers struggling to identify suitable employment 
opportunities and being locked into unfavorable work environments due to contractual obligations. By providing 
comprehensive insight into the company and facilitating transparent communication between job seekers and 
employers, the project seeks to create a dynamic ecosystem that fosters mutual growth, and they are satisfied 

\subsection{Competitive Analysis}
In Egypt's job market, traditional methods of hiring still dominate, with a reliance on personal connections and 
in-person applications. However, the emergence of online platforms has introduced new avenues for job 
seekers. Two prominent competitors in this space are Glassdoor.

\subsubsection*{Glassdoor}
Glassdoor, our main competitor, is a well-established platform known for providing company reviews, salary information, and job 
listings. While it offers valuable insights into company cultures and employee experiences globally, its 
adaptation to the Egyptian context might be limited. Glassdoor primarily relies on user-generated content, 
which may vary in quantity and quality, especially for companies with a smaller presence in Egypt. 
Additionally, the platform's focus on larger corporations might overlook opportunities within smaller or niche 
companies in the Egyptian job market.

\section{System Technical Overview}
\subsection{System Architecture}
We will use a simple, reliable, yet scalable architecture. We will use a Frontend and API connecting to a 
backend model. It is a simple model, however, it will be comfortably scalable using Kubernetes, Azure, or any 
other load balancers as we expand to have more people using our service. We will use virtualization in
expandability and have spare servers be there in case of breakdowns to minimize downtime.

\subsection{Used Technologies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend:} React.js for building a responsive and dynamic user interface
    \item \textbf{Backend:} ASP.NET Web API in .NET 8 for server-side logic, providing a reliable and efficient foundation.
    \item \textbf{Database:} MySQL/MariaDB for storing user data, reviews, and job listings, chosen for its flexibility with 
    schema design and easy to find support. Interaction with the database will be through the Entity Framework 
    Core ORM
    \item \textbf{Authentication:} Identity framework with cookie-based authentication will be used.
\end{itemize}

\section{Biggest Challenges and Mitigations}
\subsection{Challenges}
Egypt is currently very behind in terms of modernizing the hiring process, therefore it would be incredibly 
difficult to try and convince companies and people to change their old ways. Adoption of the application will 
also be difficult due to the reason we would most likely function as a startup which is also not looked to highly 
of in Egypt. Aside from initial adoption of the application, building a community of verified employees to 
provide us with reviews and insight might be also difficult as people tend to not be as open with salaries or job 
experience here. We will be challenging a lot of old stereotypes and set in stone rules of the workplace with our 
application. A more technical issue we might face are fake reviews. Finally, the legalities of sharing job reviews 
and such are not too certain in Egypt so it could be risky if not dealt with correctly.

\subsection{Solutions}
The technical issue of fake reviews could be easily solved by adding multiple human verification stages to our 
website as well as requiring identification and proof of employment to be able to post reviews that would affect 
the overall company rating while also keeping a section for unverified reviews. As for the adoption issues,
however, we could attempt to gain the userâ€™s trust by getting affiliation with trusted companies or businesses 
figures. However, it is most likely that the issue would simple be resolved with time and we have no real choice 
to kickstart our popularity. Finally, for the legalities, we could employee a part time or on demand legal team to 
help us sort it out.
